1NF: Eliminate duplicate rows and ensure atomic values in cells.

2NF: Build on 1NF and eliminate partial dependencies.
A table is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.


3NF: Build on 2NF and eliminate transitive dependencies by removing attributes dependent on non-key attributes.
A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and all non-key attributes are independent of each other.
Like non primary key columns dont depend on non primary column.

BCNF is the advance version of 3NF. It is stricter than 3NF.
A table is in BCNF if every functional dependency X â†’ Y, X is the super key of the table.
For BCNF, the table should be in 3NF, and for every FD, LHS is super key.
