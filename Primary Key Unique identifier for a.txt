Primary Key: Unique identifier for a record, and each table typically has one.

Alternate Key: Candidate key not chosen as the primary key.

Composite Key: Key composed of multiple attributes.

Candidate Key: Set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record.

Super Key: Set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record, possibly with more attributes than necessary.

Difference in primary vs unique
A primary key is a key that uniquely identifies each record in a table but cannot store NULL values.

Unique:
In contrast, a unique key prevents duplicate values in a column and can store NULL values.

Strong Entity: Can be uniquely identified by its own attributes; has a primary key.

Weak Entity: Cannot be uniquely identified by its own attributes; depends on another entity for identification and typically lacks a primary key on its own


Simple Attributes: Basic, indivisible attributes.

Composite Attributes: Composed of multiple simple attributes.

Single-Valued Attributes: Hold a single value.

Multi-Valued Attributes: Can hold multiple values.

Derived Attributes: Computed or derived from other attributes.

Complex Attributes: Rarely used attributes that can be further divided into sub-parts.



StudentID (Primary Key)
RollNumber (Alternate Key)
FirstName
LastName
BirthDate
PhoneNumber
Email

Primary Key (StudentID):
The StudentID uniquely identifies each student in the table. It serves as the primary key, ensuring that no two students have the same ID.

Alternate Key (RollNumber):
The RollNumber is an alternate key, meaning it could also serve as a primary key if needed. It provides an alternative unique identifier for each student.

Composite Key (FirstName + LastName):
The combination of FirstName and LastName forms a composite key. Together, they can uniquely identify a student, but individually, they may not be unique.

Candidate Key (PhoneNumber):
The PhoneNumber is a candidate key. While it might not be chosen as the primary key, it is a unique identifier and could serve as an alternative key.

Superkey (StudentID + PhoneNumber):
The combination of StudentID and PhoneNumber forms a superkey. A superkey is any combination of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple in a table.
