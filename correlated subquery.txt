correlated subquery:
In other words, the subquery is dependent on the outer query, and the subquery is executed for each row processed by the outer query.

SELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees e2 WHERE e2.department_id = e1.department_id);

The subquery is correlated because it refers to the e1.department_id from the outer query. For each row processed by the outer query, the subquery is executed with a specific department context.
